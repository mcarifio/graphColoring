In addition to this file itself, this archive file contains
the following files.


I. Java Source Code, some of which are templates you must finish.

Point.java
Node.java
ConnectedComponent.java
Graph.java
GenGraph.java   // for creating test data files
GraphColoringDriver.java
Turtle.java


II. The ImplementationNote.txt file discusses the algorithms.

III. Testing Materials for comparing your output to mine

for n = 2, 4, 7, 40, 41

gcIn.txt  - input file for the program
gcOn.txt  - capture of output to standard out from running the
                driver on gcIn.txt

for N = 2, 7, 40

gcNLF.jpg  - capture of the Turtle image for the LF algorithm for
              gcIN.txt
gcNSL.jpg  - capture of the Turtle image for the SL algorithm for
              gcIN.txt
gcNSLI.jpg - capture of the Turtle image for the SLI algorithm for
              gcIN.txt
gcNRLF.jpg - capture of the Turtle image for the RLF algorithm for
              gcIN.txt

gcI4 has 2000 nodes
gcI41 has 41 nodes

so neither produced any Turtle images.
